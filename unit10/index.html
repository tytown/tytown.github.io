			MOST VISITING MEXICO AND CENTRAL AMERICA DO SO PIECEMEAL for business or pleasure by cruise ships or planes. I wanted to see it slowly and close to the ground. The people, the food, the culture, the history, the landscape, the varying Spanish dialects. Looking back, the following six-month sojourn kicked off what would be years of extensive international travel.
					
			Today a river adventurer steadily approached the center of the river from upstream. The only thing vaguely familiar was the slow hypnotic undulant cadence. I had never imagined that creatures such as this truly existed. My body froze, my heart beat wildly and adrenaline poured through me. The giant anaconda saw me, I’m sure of it. I was too far from the immediate safety of shore to make a run for it. A long, thick purplish-colored tongue jolted from side to side out of a monstrous scaled head. He was now at a slight angle to my right shoulder and I began to feel the water beginning to lap lazily against my chest as the creature continued center river, downstream. I fought back early childhood memories of how the small brown Missouri river snakes could suddenly change water direction with astonishing speed in pursuit of unsuspecting frogs sunning on an elevated rock. 
			My co-inhabitant crossed perpendicularly and continued on and on as its girth appeared to double and then double again. The water now began to crest more strongly, breaking over my shoulders. Maybe 40 or 50 feet separated us, when the frozen thought came: “when will this end?” Yet he continued to pass. More frozen thoughts came. “Is it hungry? He’s at least 25 feet long – four of me, maybe more. What, four hundred, five hundred pounds? Does he see me?” – I knew he did. I waited, I prayed silently as finally the body tapered and the waves shortened. 

			Without moving my head, I now viewed the great anaconda over my left shoulder and counted to 10 with great effort and control. At the count of nine, I made my move – part swim, part water run, part leap – and scrambled to the safety of the sand pebble jungle beach.
			I was breathing heavily sitting in about three or four inches of water when M came down the banked river trail in her bathing suit with a towel over her shoulder. Seeing me sitting awkwardly with a wild look on my face, she said: “What’s wrong? You look so pale.” My only reply was “for God’s sake, M, don’t go in the water!” 
				I had experienced, I suppose, what one might consider a Jurassic Park aqua episode, to be sure.</p>
